## Lambda Functions

### Overview

Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword in Python. They are often used for short operations that are not complex enough to require a full function definition. This exercise involves examples of using lambda functions to perform basic operations.

### Files

- `lambda_functions.py`: Contains examples of basic lambda functions.

### Instructions

1. Open `lambda_functions.py`.
2. Review the examples of lambda functions provided in the script.
3. Run the script to see how lambda functions can be used in different scenarios.

### Example

Here is a simple example of a lambda function that adds two numbers:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
