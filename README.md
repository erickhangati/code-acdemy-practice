# Machine Learning Coding Practices

Welcome to my Machine Learning Coding Practices repository! This project contains a collection of coding practices, exercises, and projects that I have completed as part of my Machine Learning course from Code Academy. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and provide a reference for myself and others interested in machine learning.

## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of various coding practices I completed while learning machine learning. The practices include basic exercises, mini-projects, and more complex tasks. Each practice is designed to reinforce different concepts and techniques in machine learning.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you'll need to clone it to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for interactive coding)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/erickhangati/machine-learning-coding-practices.git
   cd machine-learning-coding-practices
   
2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
machine-learning-coding-practices/
├── pandas/
│   ├── linear_regression.py
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```
## Coding Practices

Each coding practice is documented in its respective folder with a `README.md` file explaining the problem, approach, and solution. Below is a list of the practices included:

### Pandas

* **Linear Regression**: Implementation of linear regression from scratch.
* **Logistic Regression**: Implementation of logistic regression from scratch.
